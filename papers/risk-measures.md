# Risk Measures

### Paper 1: *A high-frequency approach to Realized Risk Measures*

**Abstract:**  
We propose a novel method (RRM) for estimating Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall using high-frequency data.  
The approach extends the Realized Quantile methodology, incorporating subordinated processes and moving-average filtering to better capture volatility dynamics.
