Welcome!  
I’m a researcher working at the intersection of **Quantitative Finance**, **Econometrics**, **Decentralized Finance**, and **Machine & Deep Learning**.  
My research focuses on developing mathematical models and data-driven approaches for financial risk assessment, decentralized market design, and intelligent trading strategies.

You can explore my work through the pages above.
