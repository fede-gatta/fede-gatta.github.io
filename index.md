Welcome to my personal academic website.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of:

- **Quantitative Finance**
- **Econometrics**
- **Decentralized Finance**
- **Machine and Deep Learning**

I aim to combine rigorous mathematical modeling with data-driven methods to analyze modern financial systems — both centralized and decentralized.
