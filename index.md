Welcome to my personal website.

I am a PhD Candidate in Computational Methods and Mathematical Models for Sciences and Finance at Scuola Normale Superiore.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Quantitative Finance**, **Econometrics**, and **Machine Learning**. I am particularly focused on:
* Developing novel **Risk Measures** for financial markets.
* Analyzing **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** protocols and systemic risk.
* Applying **Machine and Deep Learning** techniques to econometric and financial time-series problems.

This website summarizes my research, publications, and professional activities.
